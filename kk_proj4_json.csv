366,Delphi Database Analyst/Programmer,Interactive Engineering Pty Ltd,"['Sydney', 'CBD, Inner West & Eastern Suburbs', 'Information & Communication Technology', 'Developers/Programmers', 'Part time']","Part-time – WFH We are developing a system called Active Structure. It reads English text and transforms it into a structure of nodes, links and operators, which can be activated. To be sufficiently flexible, it needs a database which can store and retrieve information on any sort of object - a person – Millie from Accounts, a town or city, including population and location – Strasbourg, a state – Lower Saxony, a country – El Salvador, a planet - Saturn. It would need to handle a midsized business, and later up to a corporation with tens of thousands of employees. You won’t need to handle the interface between the network of the text-reading system and the database, but the database will need to be unusually flexible in what it can transmit and receive, and create new objects in the network. Given the range of objects that can appear in text, it will be necessary to draw a line between objects that can appear in a database, and ones that need to be read about in Wikipedia. You will be involved in drawing this line. In addition to its own integrated database, a financial application being developed will require toy versions of a large bank’s accounts and transactions databases. Another database is likely to be required, to handle intermediate results. The strategies the application uses will be described in English rather than a programming language, so database access requests will need to be phrased to make it clear what is happening. You will need to understand the theory of databases, including the assumption of independent records. Assume 50 days in the first six months, with ongoing maintenance after that.
