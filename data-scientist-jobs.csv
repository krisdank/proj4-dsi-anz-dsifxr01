The broad data science team is 15-20 people but your squad will be 7. The role: Leadership or technical?This role will still be hands-on and technical in helping design, build and deliver productionised machine learning solutions in Spark (Databricks). That said - the key difference between you as a Chapter Lead compared to a senior data scientist, would be your leadership ability with your chapter. To get more specific, here are some of the main things you would do (and that will be useful to have experience with);   Translation of business problems into defined data experiments and projects Identifying opportunities for existing models and ML solutions to be used in different situations and reduce duplication of efforts Leadership and coaching for experienced & talented data scientists who will all have their own projects and day-to-day squad work Helping prioritise and unblock obstacles for your team Prioritising between competing objectives  What is the technical stack and requirements for this role?To be eligible for this role, while there is the leadership aspect, we would still need to see a track record of delivering end-to-end machine learning solutions for a large business using modern data tools. These would definitely include;  Apache Spark including productionising models  Python and Python ML libraries  Strong SQL  Led teams of at least 2 data scientists Strong stakeholder management   What are the actual selling points for this role?  This company is large (think everyday brands, millions of customers, over 5-6 million loyalty data members) and already have advanced data science maturity and support from executives A very strong technical manager and team to lead A diverse role - you will be hands-on still with cutting-edge ML with big data and future real-time analytics. But you are also contributing significantly on the business, people and leadership side Attractive permanent salary and bonus Flexible work: focus on getting things done  What is the location? Sydney or Melbourne What domain or data science experience will be ideal?It is hugely advantageous if you have worked on personalisation, loyalty data or otherwise machine learning for digital marketing. Any e-commerce or retail experience is favourable, but not mandatory."

Your days will see you leading the analysis and testing of the performance of the new systems and ratings associated with AFDRS. This will include developing new approaches to collate data from diverse sources and undertake quantitative analysis. This will involve analysing the outputs of cutting-edge models and comparing their predictions to historic records of fire incidents, grass fires and forest fires. 
You will also act as CFA's representative at bodies such as the AFDRS national working group to ensure currently of information and to ensure Victoria's interests are represented.  Your findings will be used to shape the development and implementation of the national AFDRS program.

Naturally you will be a lateral thinker and have a strong ability to problem solve and adapt to changes to research programs and proven ability to communicate complex information and results to people of non-technical background and to senior executives.
This is an exciting time to join CFA as well as providing you with an excellent opportunity to showcase your knowledge and/or experience with bushfire management, suppression and fire behaviour.
